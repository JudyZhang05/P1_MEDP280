# P1_MEDP280# README

## **Project Overview**

- The purpose of the project is to demonstrate our skills and knowledge on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, through an interactive web page to showcase my ability to design engaging and accessible user experience.
- The story I am telling through my interactive web page is the greek mytholodolgy Daedalus and Icarus. The key interactions are users clicking right or left side of the screen and/or using the keyboard left and right arrow keys to navigate through the story. In addition, for a couple of the drawings, upon user's click, the image will change to give a different perspective.

## **Figma Design**

- Here is the [link](https://www.figma.com/design/BhAzvxrm8QQSp6u1tkSZu2/COLLEGE?node-id=18-2&node-type=canvas&t=wNRHpEbqVXdSpjRB-0) to the Figma design of the webpage.
- Using the progressive enhancement approach for my web page, I ensured all the elements I was implementing would work well in a smaller screen and wouldn't clutter or conflict with each other. Ultimately the design is a simple, concise, and straightforward. For accesibility considerations, I used a ratio of 21:1 with the black background and white text color. (Note* The final product features some variations to the original design)

## **Features**

- List the key features of the project, including:
    - **Animations**: For the animations, I incorporated a variety and mix of keyframes, transitions, and GSAP library functions. GSAP was used to configure the typewriter effect, transitions for the enlargement and minimization of images, and keyframes for some minor supplemental animations to enhance the users immersion.
    - **Sound Effects**: For sound, I implmented 2 music scores that tie in the whole project. Once the user reaches a certain turning point in the story the music changes.
    - **User-triggered Events**: I choose a more direct approach to my project. Instead of the usual scrolling events, I confined my story to one screen that alternates back and forth. There are two interactive ways for the user to progress, the keyboard left and right arrow keys will control the story or tapping the right and left side of the screen controls the story. Addtionally to enhance the experience I made a clicking event for a couple of the images showcased throughout the story, where they will change to a different image that will show a different perspective.
    - **Responsive Design**: The design adapts from web to mobile by the font size and image width. I aimed for the most optimal experience through any which device with the best of my ability.
